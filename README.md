## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

I've been a full-stack developer making applications, scripts, and fun projects since 2015. Started with Python and Discord bots, now building full-stack apps with Typescript and exploring embedded systems. Big fan of open-source software, self-hosting, and homelabbing. Here's a breakdown of my tech stack I've picked up along my almost decade-long journey.

- TypeScript is my bread and butter, using it for almost all projects
- JavaScript was my primary language before transitioning to TypeScript
- Python was my first programming language, now mainly used for scripting
- Rust is my latest learning adventure, really enjoying systems programming
- Java & Kotlin experience from university projects
- Haskell was a fascinating university course that I'd love to revisit
- Go is my next language to learn
